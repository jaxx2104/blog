> I believe all startups should hire a VP of engineering, and early — bringing them on before the problems begin, even if this may seem a bit too soon relative to total headcount. Many young startups believe they don't need a VP of engineering because their engineering team is either sufficiently senior or perhaps too small. But it's hard to overstate the importance of the role.

> A strong VP of engineering provides the backbone for an engineering function that withstands the pressure of the business, while also growing the org and without letting it collapse under the weight of an ad hoc process. Setting the right culture and the right process is something you want endemic to the organization, independent of size — and that's exactly what hiring the right VP of engineering at the right time will do.
